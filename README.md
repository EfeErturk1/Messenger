CS411 Project 2

To run the code, first, you need to create a schema named "cs411project2" in your mysql server, which is version 8 or above. 
Then you should first run the backend server using an IDE like Intellij, and then the frontend part.

Source of codes are in /src/main/java/com/example/cs411_proj2/ path

Test codes are in /src/test/java/com/example/cs411_proj2/ path, but the project is tested manually using Postman, without using the codes in this directory
